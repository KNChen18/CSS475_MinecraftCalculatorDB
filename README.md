# CSS475_MinecraftCalculatorDB

# This is a repository for our CSS475 Database System's Final Project

# We were tasked to create a database project akin to real-world industry design
# included we have a work in progress document with UML models demonstrating our process in developing the database and the UI that comes with it.

# For our project we went along and based it off the hit video game Minecraft. In our database we use data from the video game itself about                                    # armour, weapons, enchantments, recipes, potions, mobs, and material to sort of report/calculate the damage/protection the user will experience in the given Minecraft        # fighting simulation.
