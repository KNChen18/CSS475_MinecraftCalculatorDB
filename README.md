# CSS475_MinecraftCalculatorDB

This is a repository for our CSS475 Database System's Final Project

We were tasked to create a database project akin to real-world industry design
Included we have a work in progress document with UML models demonstrating our process in developing the database and the UI that comes with it.

For our project we went along and inspired it off the hit video game, Minecraft. In our database we use data from the video game itself as well as our own self-created aspects in regards to armour, weapons, enchantments, recipes, potions, mobs, and material. We use the data in regards to the listed components/entities and report/calculate the damage/protection the user will experience in the given fighting simulation.
